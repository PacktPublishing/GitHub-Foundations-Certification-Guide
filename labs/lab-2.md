# Lab 2.1: Familiarity with the GitHub Interface
In this lab, we will walk through the basics of the GitHub interface and get exposed to the terminologies used, the menus. By the end of this lab, you would be able to find your way around on GitHub.
## Explore Open-Source Repos
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You do not need a GitHub account for this.
1.	Visit [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore).
    This is where you can explore the latest about GitHub such as developer and open-source news, latest. videos, trending developers, trending repos and popular topics.
2.	Click on **Trending**.
    This will show you a list of the current most popular open-source repos. You can filter by spoken language, programming/scripting language, and period.

    On each row of records, you will find important information about each repo: 
        1.	The repository name: This is usually in the format {owner}/{repo_name}, where owner is the owner of the repo, i.e. either individual or organization; and the repo_name is the name of the repository.
        2.	Stars: The number of stars a repository has is the number of people (developers) that have bookmarked the repo. A repo earns a star every time someone stars that repo (adds to their bookmarks).
        3.	Language: This is the language the source code in the repo is mostly written in. This is derived from the language with most lines of code across all the files in the repo. Remember, a repo can have multiple languages co-existing in different files in it. This may be a programming, scripting, markup, or markdown language.
        4.	Built by: This is a list of the top contributors of the repo’s contents. This is usually represented by their avatars. Clicking on the avatar will take you to the profile page of the contributor.

4.	Visit [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp). This will take you to the freeCodeCamp repository, one of the most widely used open-source repos. Scroll down to read the README. Then, explore the source code by browsing through the directories you see there.
    > The README is the landing page of a GitHub repo where you can find an overview of what the repo contains. It is a crucial documentation you provide to help visitors and contributors understand the repo.
5.	Visit [linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux). This will take you to the primary open-source repository containing the source code for the Linux kernel, maintained by Linus Torvalds and the Linux community. Explore the source code by browsing through the directories you see there.

Steps 3 and 4 are examples of open-source repos, millions of which exist on GitHub. Notice how the word “Public” is written next to the repository name at the top-right? This indicates that the repo is public. You are free to view the source code, suggest changes, or outrightly contribute to it as the license permits. More information is available about open-source licenses in Chapter 11: Contributing to Open-Source Projects.
You would also realize that you have been browsing all these repositories and source codes without an account or without signing in. Next, let us create a GitHub individual account.
